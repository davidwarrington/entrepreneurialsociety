# Entrepreneurial Society Website

## Set up:

1. Run `npm install`. This will install all of the npm packages listed in `package.json`.
2. Run `gulp`. This will run a background task that watches for file changes in the `src` folder. These files are then moved to the `dist` folder for viewing in browser. This task will also open an auto-refreshing 'Browser-Sync' tab in your default browser.
